              <p>It's a very fair question. Both sound natural. Both sound gentle. And if you've been feeling tired, stressed, or unwell for a while, you're probably looking at all your options.</p>
              <p>I've been helping people feel better using naturopathy for years, and I often explain the difference in simple terms—because honestly, the two are very different. Let's walk through it together.</p>

                  Naturopathy is a special type of natural health care that looks at the whole person—not just one symptom they're having. It's about finding out what's really going on inside your body and helping it get back into balance.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                  When I work with someone, I look at everything—their gut health, hormones, energy, sleep, diet, movement, and even stress levels. All of these things are actually connected. Naturopathy works by supporting the body to heal itself, using natural tools like herbal medicine, nutrition, and some lifestyle changes.

                  Say you've been feeling bloated after meals and tired. In naturopathy, I'd want to know: what foods are you eating? Are you digesting well? How's your stress? Are your hormones playing a part? Then we'd build a plan together—maybe some gut healing herbs, changes to your meals, and ways to improve your sleep and your stress levels.

                <div className="space-y-3 text-muted-foreground">
                  <p>Homeopathy is built on a big idea that: <strong className="text-foreground">"like cures like."</strong></p>
                  <p>So that means if a substance can cause symptoms in a healthy person, giving a tiny, tiny amount of that same substance might help someone who has those symptoms.</p>
                  <p>For example, if cutting an onion makes your eyes water and your nose run, a homeopathic remedy made from onion might be used to treat a cold or an allergy that causes those same symptoms.</p>

                <div className="space-y-3 text-muted-foreground">
                  <p>Here's the part that confuses most people—homeopathic remedies are diluted over and over again. We're talking really diluted. So much so, that in many cases, there's no measurable part of the original ingredient left.</p>
                  <p>What's left behind, according to homeopathic thinking, is the "energy" or "vibration" of the substance. That's what's believed to trigger the body to actually heal.</p>
                  <p>It's not about the ingredient itself—it's about how your body responds to its energetic imprint.</p>
                  <p>Some people love how gentle and subtle it is. Others prefer something more measurable and hands-on—like what we do in naturopathy.</p>

                  The Experience with a Homeopath
                </h3>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                  A homeopath will ask deep questions about your physical symptoms, but also your emotions, your dreams, your fears, and your personality. And based on that, they'll choose a remedy that matches your overall pattern. There's no testing, and the remedies usually come in little sugar pills or drops.

                  Homeopathy and Emotions
                </h3>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                  Homeopathy often focuses a lot on emotional themes. Remedies are chosen based on personality traits and emotional patterns, not just your physical symptoms. Some people find this style of healing incredibly gentle and intuitive.

              <p>You don't have to pick one forever. Some people start with just one and try the other later. Others use both alongside each other at the same time.</p>
              <p>The best healing path is the one that fits you—your body, your lifestyle, and your personal preference.</p>
              <p>If you're feeling unsure, talk to both kinds of practitioners. Ask questions. Get a feel for their style. And trust your gut.</p>

              <p>Natural healing doesn't have to be confusing. Both naturopathy and homeopathy offer valuable paths—but they're different in how they work, what they focus on, and the tools they use.</p>
              <p>If you're leaning toward naturopathy and want to understand what's really going on in your body, that's where I come in.</p>
              <p>At my clinic in New Farm, I use naturopathy, nutrition, functional testing, and movement to support real change. I'm here to help people who feel tired, bloated, or just not themselves anymore—finally feel strong again.</p>
              <p>Still not sure? That's okay. You can always reach out and ask questions. I'm more than happy to help.</p>
