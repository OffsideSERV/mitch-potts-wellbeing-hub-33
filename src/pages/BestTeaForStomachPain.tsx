                  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>Try peppermint after big meals</li>
                    <li>Use chamomile in the evenings to calm your whole system</li>
                    <li>Blend fennel and ginger together for double relief</li>

                    <li>Drink it warm—not hot, not cold</li>
                  </ul>
